# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

## How to Use (Eventually)

This UI is meant to visualize and interact with JSON output generated by a separate analysis script (written in PowerShell, because I’m like that). That script is currently not public—but the plan is:

- Import JSON from a folder-structure analysis script
- Visualize file & folder relationships
- Interactively categorize, sort, and restructure your filesystem
- Prevent destruction of project folders while still being able to overhaul everything else
- Have fun doing it. Maybe. Ideally.

**Why?** Because cleaning sucks. But *game-ifying* cleaning? That’s design.
Right now, this is mostly scaffolding and experimentation.
