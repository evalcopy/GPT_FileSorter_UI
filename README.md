# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

I'm a noob at development, I'm trying to see if I can get GPT to help me build an application that 
1. looks at a directory or bunch of directories
2. does a quick scan of naming convention for folders & files
3. displays this info on the screen with info about the files like an explorer
4. allows you to manipulate the tree structure/reorganize your files based on type or new input convention
5. reorganizes your actual tree

this code is step #3, the file scanner I've got written in Powershell, and it's outputing into a .json, and this is intended to be a .json interpreter.

I hope it's pretty, I want it to be super interactive, because I hate cleaning, cleanining is boring. 
let's make a cleaning tool fun.

and by let's, I mean watch me stumble through this and get something kinda working.
